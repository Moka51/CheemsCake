                           <p>
                              CAKEBAKER is the newest passive rewards token on the BSC to pay holders with dividends in the world famous token CAKE. 
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Entering the world of Decentralized Finance hasn’t been easier until recently. Anyone can start earning passive income automatically just by being a holder of CakeBaker. 
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              Utilizing the innovative Reflection Token technology your Passive Rewards will be added to your wallet multiple times throughout the day without the need to claim. Your daily rewards can be viewed with our handy dashboard. 
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              A lottery rewards game will be available on our website soon after launch where holders can earn more CAKEBAKER and limited NFT’s. More utility will be added as we progress and grow the CAKEBAKER community. Our goal is to evolve the auto-claim CAKE reward mechanism.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              CAKEBAKER to put it briefly is the next evolution of a yield-generating contract on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC): you get rewarded in CAKE automatically. The token contract employs a static rewards system—12% of every BUY transaction is split in to:<br>
                              <!--- 5% CAKE (Pancakeswap) is redistributed to holders<br>
                              - 3% used to fuel the liquidity pool<br>
                              - 4% allocated to the Marketing and Developement wallet. -->
                              - <b>5% Rewards in CAKE</b><br>
                              - <b>4% to Marketing</b><br>

                              Swing trading is a common practice that can affect price action. To incentivize holding and reducing pump/dump dynamics, we added an 14% sell fee that will be used to buy back CAKEBAKER tokens in times of volitily to protect investors.  <br>
                              Total Sell Fee = 14%

                           </h3>
                           <P>
                              Our system auto-claims for every single holder the amount due based on their proportional share of CAKEBAKER holdings. How it works for holders: You buy CAKEBAKER tokens and hold them, then approximately every 60 minutes you’ll automatically receive CAKE in your wallet. No further action is required. It’s that simple to earn passive income as a CAKEBAKER Holder.
                           </P>

                              CAKEBAKER will have a working lottery game shortly after launch that token holders will be able to participate in and potentially win additional rewards. 50% of the tokens accumilated will be burnt and other 50% will go back to the rewards pool.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              NFT: As our community and awareness grows, we will introduce our collection of limited NFT collectables that holders will be able to stake and earn rewards.

                              Note: In periods of low volume CAKE (Pancakeswap) may not be sent out every hour, but don’t worry. Your rewards are accumulating and then distributed when ready through out the day. You can also manually claim your rewards in our dashboard.

                              How it’s organized:
                           </h3>
                          <p>
                              -	The contract keeps track in an array of all token holders <br>
                              -	The contract keeps an index into the array for processing<br>
                              -	Every transaction processes a certain number of users, depending on the transaction size (bigger token transfers can process more, since the gas will still be proportionally less than the value of the tokens)<br>
                              -	The token is based on a Dividend-Paying Token Standard, which means all CAKE the smart contract gains will be split equally proportionally to the token holders.<br>
                              -	When a user is processed, the contract checks how many withdrawal dividends they have, and if it is above the minimum threshold for auto-claims, it will either automatically claim those dividends for CAKE, or automatically buy back tokens for them.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              This system is fully automated and doesn’t add minimal gas fees proportional to the value transferred. The number of holders processed through each transaction is dynamic and based on the transaction size. Holders will receive dividends from the queue based on their position in the array. It’s a fair system, fully automated. Minimum token balance is 20000 CAKEBAKER tokens to receive CAKE distributions.
